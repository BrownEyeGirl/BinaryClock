    <h2>The Binary Clock</h2>
    <h3>

    <p>
      So... what is a binary clock? A binary clock is a clock that represents the time in
      binary numbers. The red represents the hours, the green represents the minutes, and the blue 
      represents the seconds.

      <h2>The Idea Behind the Project</h2>
      <p>I decided to build a binary clock because I wanted to try circuitry and I wanted to learn how to read binary. I chose the colours red, green,
        and blue for my clock because they are the colours of light and I needed the different colours to differentiate between hours, minutes and seconds.
        I chose to learn Python because it can also be used for machine learning, complex algorithms, robotics and is becoming a one of the most popular 
        languages of my generation. My main goal for the project was to complete it without copying any code or designs from the internet, my peers, 
        or my teachers. This meant that I could only ask a question when I absolutely could not figure out the answer, and all the code had to be written 
        by me. It also meant that my project design had to be original which wasn’t hard because very few people on the internet have dedicated a year of 
        their life to create a binary clock.</p>
